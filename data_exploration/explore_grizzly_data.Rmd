### Tabular grizzly data

DataBC has data on [population estimates](http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/2012-grizzly-bear-population-estimates) and [mortality](http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/history-of-grizzly-bear-mortalities). Let's download and explore both:

```{r}
## getting the data
mortality <- read.csv("http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/archive/data/plants-and-animals/2012_Grizzly_Status/Grizzly_bear_mortality_history.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

population <- read.csv("http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/archive/data/plants-and-animals/2012_Grizzly_Status/Grizzly_population_estimate_2012.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

### Grizzly Bear Population Units spatial data

First, you will need to get the data. Unfortunately, unlike the `.csv` files, we are unable to read/download this directly from DataBC. Visit the [metadata record](http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/grizzly-bear-population-units/resource/7a7713f9-bcbd-46b8-968a-03d343d367fb) for the data at DataBC. Click on the **Go To Resource** button and submit the form with the following settings:

![](img/Griz_form.png)

When you get the email with the link to the zip file, save it in your working directory as `data/DataBC_GBPU.zip`

Unzip the file, and import the shapefile. You will need the `sp` and `rgdal` packages

```{r messate = FALSE}
unzip("data/DataBC_GBPU.zip", exdir = "data")

gbpu <- readOGR(dsn = "data/GBPU_BC", layer = "GBPU_BC_polygon", 
                encoding = "ESRI Shapefile", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Now that we have the data, let's look at the tabular data first - here's a glimpse of it. 

```{r results='asis'}
kable(head(mortality))
```

We're going to use the [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) and [tidyr](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr) packages to organize and clean our data. First, we'll work on the mortality data:

```{r results='asis'}

## let's get rid of unused columns
mortality <- mortality %>% 
  select(-contains("X."))

# Now we can separate the AGE_CLASS column into two columns specifying the 
# minumum age and the maximum age
clean_mort <- mortality %>%
  separate(AGE_CLASS, into = c("minimum_age", "maximum_age"), sep = "-", 
           extra = "merge") %>% 
  mutate(minimum_age = extract_numeric(minimum_age),
         maximum_age = extract_numeric(maximum_age))

kable(head(clean_mort))
```

Let's tidy up the population data. The first, eighth, and ninth columns (`X.`) doesn't contain any useful information, so we can get rid if it:

```{r}
## We can do it directly on each column like so:
# population$X <- NULL
# population$X.1 <- NULL
# population$X.2 <- NULL

## Or we can use a loop to do it.  This would be effective if there 
## were a lot of columns we wanted to get rid of

for (n in names(population)) {
  if (grepl("X", n)) {
    population[n] <- NULL
  }
}
```

Now we see that there is some metadata in the first five rows of the `Notes.` column. We should remove it and store it in a variable:

```{r}
population_meta <- paste(population$Notes.[1:5], collapse = "; ")
population$Notes. <- NULL
```

We can store the metadata as a comment attribute of the population data frame:

```{r}
comment(population) <- population_meta
```

We can view the comment using similar syntax:

```{r}
comment(population)
```

The population estimates are split up by Population Unit (`GBPU`) and Management Unit (`MU`). Let's summarise by Population Unit. `dplyr` has some great functions for this sort of exploratory analysis.

```{r}
## First we set the grouping variable to be GBPU
population_gbpu <- group_by(population, GBPU)

## Then we can summarize based on those groups. We will need to recalculate 
## the density.
population_gbpu <- summarise(population_gbpu, 
                             Estimate = sum(Estimate, na.rm = TRUE), 
                             Total_Area = sum(Total_Area, na.rm = TRUE), 
                             Density = Estimate / Total_Area * 1000)
head(population_gbpu)
```

### Let's explore the gbpu spatial object. 

It is of class `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`, which is a special class of **R** object for representing spatial data, implemented in the `sp` package.

```{r}
class(gbpu)
summary(gbpu)
```

From the [metadata page](http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/grizzly-bear-population-units/resource/7a7713f9-bcbd-46b8-968a-03d343d367fb), we know that there are several versions of the population units in this file. From the summary above it looks like the version is stored in the `GBPU_VERS`. Let's only use the latest version (2012). Note that we can use subsetting using `[` just like we do on normal data frames.

We can then plot the polygons to have a quick look.

```{r gbpu_map}
gbpu <- gbpu[gbpu$GBPU_VERS == 2012, ]
plot(gbpu)
```

Now that we have a map of GBPUs, and a data frame with a single population estimate per GBPU, we can merge the population estimates into the SpatialPolygonsDataFrame.

```{r}
## First we should make sure that the GBPU names in the two objects are the same
setdiff(na.omit(gbpu$GBPU_NAME), population_gbpu$GBPU)
setdiff(population_gbpu$GBPU, na.omit(gbpu$GBPU_NAME))
population_gbpu$GBPU[population_gbpu$GBPU == "Central Purcells"] <- "Central-South Purcells"
population_gbpu$GBPU[population_gbpu$GBPU == "North Purcell"] <- "North Purcells"

## Check to make sure they are equal now
all.equal(sort(population_gbpu$GBPU), sort(na.omit(gbpu$GBPU_NAME)))
```

Now lets plot the map using ggplot2, and fill the polygons based on population density. First we need to use the function `fortify` from `ggplot2`, to turn the SpatialPolygonsDataFrame into a data frame, then merge the attributes from `population_gbpu`:

```{r density-map}
gbpu_df <- fortify(gbpu, region = "GBPU_NAME")
gbpu_df <- merge(gbpu_df, population_gbpu, by.x = "id", by.y = "GBPU")

ggplot(gbpu_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = Density)) + 
  geom_path(colour = "white") + 
  coord_map() + 
  theme_minimal()
```
